# Introduction

In the wake of the *Dobbs vs Jackson* ruling that ended the federal guarantee of abortion rights in the United States, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Court John Roberts defended the Court's legitimacy.[^1] Despite Roberts' arguments, many Americans read the controversial decision as an inappropriate intertwining of legal decision-making and ideological bias. For instance, a Pew Research Center survey conducted after the *Dobbs* decision found that more than 50% of Democrat respondents thought that the Supreme Court did a poor job of keeping their political views out of how they decide cases [@PositiveViewsSupreme2022]. This is nearly double the share of Democratic respondents who reported the same view before the *Dobbs* decision[@PositiveViewsSupreme2022].

[^1]: This is consistent with Roberts' famous claim that "Judges are like umpires" at his confirmation hearing.

One tempting conclusion to draw from *Dobbs* is that the judiciary -- often imagined as politically neutral or, at least, politically insulated -- has finally and fully caught up to the legislative branches in partisan polarization. Indeed, in 21% percent of the Supreme Court's 2021-term decisions, the Justices voted strictly according to the party of appointing President -- the highest this percentage has been since at least 1953 [@thomson-deveauxJustHowSharp2022]. Public opinion surveys show that the median preference of Supreme Court Justices is much closer to median preferences of the median Republican voter on issues like abortion, health care and civil rights [@jesseeDecadelongLongitudinalSurvey2022].

\[This paper argues\]. Although an enormous body of evidence attests to the presence of ideology among judges, disagreement persists about its content and importance: in particular, whether it may be described one or several dimensions, and how these dispositions impact actual case outcomes. To preview, I briefly review existing attempts to conceptualize and measure judicial ideology. I then present a Bayesian ideal point model.

# Measuring Judicial Ideology 

Bonica and Sen review the primary approaches to measurement of judicial ideology [@bonicaEstimatingJudicialIdeology2021]. To preview, existing attempts to measure judicial ideology suffer at least one of three limitations: (1) a failure to incorporate or describe the ideologies of judges outside the lower federal and states courts (2); a failure to ; and (3) a failure to incorporate information about case outcomes into the measurement of ideology.

Martin and Quinn... dynamic item response model to model policy preferences of Supreme Court justices over time[@martinDynamicIdealPoint2002]. Unidimensional preferences measure. Relatively agnostic about (case content), besides using judges as anchor points for identification. The judges were (Harlan, Douglas, Marshall, Brennan, Frankfurter, Fortas, Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas). However, as Bonica and Sen have argued, this ignores (selection effects related to the court's docket.)

Coding-based approaches... [@epsteinJudicialCommonSpace2007]

Difficulty justifying the coding. Campaign contributions... [@bonicaCommonspaceScalingAmerican2017]

Difficulty justifying the focus on a single dimension or difficulty identifying multiple dimensions. Identification problem comes from Rivers [@riversIdentificationMultidimensionalSpatial2003]. Lauderdale and Clark solve this problem by [@lauderdaleScalingPoliticallyMeaningful2014].

# Data

Until recently, data that links \[judges and decisions\] has been very difficult to obtain, especially for judges outside the Supreme Court.

# Methods

The greatest obstacle to measuring judicial ideology *as it arises in actual legal decisions -* the "facts of the case" are different in every case. Furthermore,

Intuitively,

This intuition also explains why Bayesian analysis . .

In this section, I describe formally how to \[\--\] this by adapting an item-response-model popular in the analysis of roll-call voting to judicial

# Exploratory Factor Analysis

We employ an ideal point model (13) that estimates the ideological position of each respondent based on their survey responses, each justice (and the court) based on their votes (and rulings) on all cases in a given term, and the perceived ideological position of the court held by each respondent based on their expectations about the court's rulings in the surveyed cases.

## 2PL Model

The typical

$$
P(y_{ij} | \eta_j, \alpha_i, \beta_i) \sim \Psi^{-1}(\alpha_i+ \beta_i {\eta_j}^\top)
$$

$$
y_{ij} | \eta_j, \alpha_i, \beta_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\Psi^{-1}(\alpha_i + \beta_i {\eta_j}^\top))
$$

-   $\beta_i$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of discrimination parameters
-   $\eta_j$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of ability parameters
-   $\Psi^{-1}(\mu)$ is the inverse logit function, $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\mu)}$
-   The "logit" link function, $\Psi = \log(\frac{1}{1-\mu})$

$$
P(y_{ij} | \eta_j) = \begin{cases}
\text{if } s = 0,\Phi(\gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \eta_j) \\
\text{if } s = 1, (1-\Phi(\gamma_0 +\gamma_1 \eta_j)) \times (\Psi^{-1}(\beta_i \eta_j-\alpha_i))

-   $\beta_i$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of discrimination parameters
-   $\eta_j$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of ability parameters
-   $\gamma_1$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of settlement parameters
-   $\Psi^{-1}(\mu)$ is the inverse logit function, $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\mu)}$
