# Introduction

In the wake of the *Dobbs vs Jackson* ruling that ended the federal guarantee of abortion rights, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Court John Roberts defended the Court's legitimacy at  .[^1] Despite Roberts' arguments, many Americans read the controversial decision as an inappropriate intertwining of legal decision-making and ideological bias. For instance, a Pew Research Center survey conducted after the *Dobbs* decision found that  more than 50% of Democrat respondents indicated that the Supreme Court did a poor job of keeping their political views out of how they decide cases [@nwPositiveViewsSupreme2022]. This is nearly double the share of Democratic respondents who reported the same view before the *Dobbs* decision [@nwPositiveViewsSupreme2022]. 

Although an enormous body of evidence attests to the presence of idealogy among judges, disagreement persists about its content and importance: in particular, whether it may be described one or several dimensions, and how these dispositions relate to case outcomes.  To preview, I briefly review existing attempts to conceptualize and measure judicial ideaology. I then present a Bayesian IRT model. 
  
Bonica and Sen review the primary approaches to measurement of judicial ideology. [@bonicaEstimatingJudicialIdeology2021a] To preview, existing attempts to measure judicial idealogy suffer at least one of three limitations: (1) a failure to incorporate or describe the ideaologies of judges outside the lower federal and states courts (2); a failure to  ; and (3) a failure to incoporate information about case outcomes into the measurement of ideaology.

# Judicial Ideaology

Martin and Quinn... dynamic item response model to model policy preferences of Supreme Court justices over time [@martinDynamicIdealPoint2002a]. Unidimensional preferences measure. Relatively agnostic about (case content), besides using judges as anchor points for identication. The judges were (Harlan, Douglas, Marshall, Brennan, Frankfurter, Fortas, Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas). However, as Bonica and Sen have argued, this ignores (selection effects related to the court's docket.) 

Coding-based approaches... [@epsteinJudicialCommonSpace2007] 

Difficulty justifying the coding. Campaign contributions...
[@bonicaCommonspaceScalingAmerican2017]

Difficulty justifying the focus on a single dimension or difficulty identifying multiple dimensions. Idenitication problem comes from Rivers [@rivers2003]. Lauderdale and Clark solve this problem by .

## 2PL Model

$$
P(y_{ij} | \eta_j, \alpha_i, \beta_i) \sim \Psi^{-1}(\alpha_i+ \beta_i {\eta_j}^\top)
$$


$$
y_{ij} | \eta_j, \alpha_i, \beta_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\Psi^{-1}(\alpha_i + \beta_i {\eta_j}^\top))
$$

- $\beta_i$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of discrimination parameters
- $\eta_j$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of ability parameters
* $\Psi^{-1}(\mu)$ is the inverse logit function, $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\mu)}$
* The "logit" link function, $\Psi = \log(\frac{1}{1-\mu})$

## 2PL Model with Hurdle

$$
P(y_{ij} | \eta_j) = \begin{cases}
\text{if } s = 0,\Phi(\gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \eta_j) \\
\text{if } s = 1, (1-\Phi(\gamma_0 +\gamma_1 \eta_j)) \times (\Psi^{-1}(\beta_i \eta_j-\alpha_i))

- $\gamma_1$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of settlement parameters
- $\Psi^{-1}(\mu)$ is the inverse logit function, $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\mu)}$

# Confirmatory Factor Analysis

Constrain the analysis by assuming that each latent factor contributes to one and only one indicator. [@lauderdalePragmaticSocialMeasurement2021] This permits the use of hypothesis testing 

This two-step approach has been used to study latent ideological
