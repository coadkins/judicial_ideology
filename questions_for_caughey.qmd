# Background

This project measures the ideaologies of federal court judges in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. District Courts directly under its jurisdiction. By contrast with other recent efforts, my approach uses the outcomes of actual judicial practice - including both final rulings and settlements - to estimate ideal points for each judge along two dimensions. 

In a literature review, I argue that I improve upon existing attempts to measure judicial idealogy by: (1) describing the ideaologies of judges who practice outside of the U.S. Supreme Court [@martinDynamicIdealPoint2002, @epsteinJudicialCommonSpace2007]; (2) relying on case outcomes and litigant settlements instead of out-of-court behaviors to describe judicial ideaology [@bonicaCommonspaceScalingAmerican2017]; and (3) treating skeptically judges in-court descriptions of their own behavior. [@lauderdalePragmaticSocialMeasurement2021]  

# Description of Data

The data for this project comes the Federal Judicial Center's (FJC) database of federal court filings and the FJC Biographical Database. Newly available data from the Courtlistener project allows linkage of these records for the first time.

Federal District Court and Appeals Court Filings between 1988 and 2020

113 judges

23,401
2,972 appeals cases heard by a panel of judges
28 categories of cases

Case outcomes are coded by conservativsm
1 = case decided by judge for defendant
2 = case voluntarly settled or withdrawn by one or both
litigants
3 = case decided by judge for plaintiff
Cases decided by Jury are excluded

# General Strategy

For each judge, I estimate the ideal point $\eta_j$ along or or two idealogical dimensions. I begin with a standard 2 Parameter Logitistic (2PL) model familiar from item response theory, but without constraints on the sign of the discrimination parameter, following Clinton, Jackman and Rivers ([@jackmanMultidimensionalAnalysisRoll2001 @riversIdentificationMultidimensionalSpatial2003, @clintonStatisticalAnalysisRoll2004]. 

$$
P(y_{ij} | \eta_j, \alpha_i, \beta_i) \sim \Psi(\alpha_i+ \beta_i {\eta_j}^\top)
$$

This model can only account for the binary outcome of a conservative or liberal judicial choice. To allow information about settlement to effect the estimation of $\eta_j$, I embed the 2PL model in a "hurdle" model, following Kubinec. ([@kubinecIdealstanPackageIdeal2018])

The hurdle model ... 

I discuss the details and identification strategy for each model below. 

# Outstanding Issues

(1) For all three models, the estimated ideals points for all judges reflect weak polarization on one or both dimensions. Furthermore, neither the one-dimensional or two-dimensional ideal points track very well the political party of the judges appointing President. This may be a true fact about the world; but is somewhat inconsistent with other evidence about recent politicization and polarization of the judiciary. [@bonicaJudicialTugWar2020c]  

(2) The posterior predictive distribution of case outcomes predicts the empirical distribution of case outcomes with only moderate accuracy. In particular, the posterior predictive distributions for all three models overestimates the share of "liberal" outcomes, whether or not settlements are included in the model. All models also slightly underestimate the share of "conservative" outcomes.

(3) At present, the assignment of case categories to outcomes relies only on my judgement. In the longer term, the assignment of case categories to outcomes would benefit from stronger quantitative justifications. 

# Models and Results

## One Dimensional 2PL Model with No Hurdle

$$
P(y_{ij} | \eta_j, \alpha_i, \beta_i) \sim \Psi(\alpha_i+ \beta_i {\eta_j}^\top)
$$
$$
y_{ij} | \eta_j, \alpha_i, \beta_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\Psi^{-1}(\alpha_i + \beta_i {\eta_j}^\top))
$$

- $\beta_i$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of discrimination parameters
- $\eta_j$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of ability parameters
* $\Psi$ is the "logit" link function, $\Psi = \log(\frac{1}{1-\mu})$
* $\Psi^{-1}(\mu)$ is the inverse logit function, $\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\mu)}$

Identification for the one dimensional model requires. [@riversIdentificationMultidimensionalSpatial2003] 

Following Kubinec, I create these constraints by estimating the model two times. The first estimate [only 0]. In the second estimate, I constrain those values of $eta_j$ in the highest or lowest **10 percent** of the estimates from the first model to be positive or negative, respectively.

## One Dimensional 2PL Model with Hurdle

::: {.hidden}
$$
P(y_{ij} | \eta_j) = \begin{cases}
\text{if } s = 0,\Phi(\gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \eta_j) \\
\text{if } s = 1, (1-\Phi(\gamma_0 +\gamma_1 \eta_j)) \times (\Psi^(\beta_i \eta_j-\alpha_i))
\end{cases}
$$
::: 

- $\beta_i$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of discrimination parameters
- $\eta_j$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of ability parameters
- $\gamma_1$ is a $[1 \times d]$ vector of settlement parameters
- $\Psi$ is the "logit" link function, $\Psi = \log(\frac{1}{1-\mu})$
- $\Phi$ is the normal cumulative distribution function.

The posterior predictive distribution of outcomes overestimates the proportion of liberal outcomes relative to the empirical distribution, and also slightly underestimates the share of conservative outcomes. (Note: values of -1 correspond to settlements)
